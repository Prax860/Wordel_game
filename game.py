INSTRUCTIONS:
    1) A random 5-letter word is selected by the computer. The objective of the game is to guess the word within 6 moves.

    2) The user must enter valid 5-letter words every time they wish to make a guess.

    3) Incorrect letters of the guess become visible in the 'Incorrect Letters' list.

    4) Correct letters that are in the correct position are visible as 'UPPERCASE' characters.

    5) Correct letters that are in the wrong position are visible as 'lowercase' characters.
